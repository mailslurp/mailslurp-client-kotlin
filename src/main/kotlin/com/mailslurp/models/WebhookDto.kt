/**
 * Representation of a webhook for an inbox. The URL specified will be using by MailSlurp whenever an email is received by the attached inbox. A webhook entity should have a URL that points to your server. Your server should accept HTTP/S POST requests and return a success 200. MailSlurp will retry your webhooks if they fail. See https://api.mailslurp.com/schemas/webhook-payload for the payload schema.
 * @param id ID of the Webhook
 * @param userId User ID of the Webhook
 * @param basicAuth Does webhook expect basic authentication? If true it means you created this webhook with a username and password. MailSlurp will use these in the URL to authenticate itself.
 * @param name Name of the webhook
 * @param inboxId The inbox that the Webhook will be triggered by
 * @param url URL of your server that the webhook will be sent to. The schema of the JSON that is sent is described by the payloadJsonSchema.
 * @param method HTTP method that your server endpoint must listen for
 * @param payloadJsonSchema Deprecated. Fetch JSON Schema for webhook using the getJsonSchemaForWebhookPayload method
 * @param createdAt When the webhook was created
 * @param updatedAt 
 * @param eventName
