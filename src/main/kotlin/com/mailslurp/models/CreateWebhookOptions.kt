 * @param url Public URL on your server that MailSlurp can post WebhookNotification payload to when an email is received or an event is trigger. The payload of the submitted JSON is dependent on the webhook event type. The default `EMAIL_RECEIVED` payload is described by `https://api.mailslurp.com/schemas/webhook-payload`. The other events, `NEW_EMAIL`, `NEW_CONTACT`, and `NEW_ATTACHMENT` are described by `https://api.mailslurp.com/schemas/webhook-new-email-payload`, `https://api.mailslurp.com/schemas/webhook-new-contact-payload`,`https://api.mailslurp.com/schemas/webhook-new-attachment-payload` respectively.
 * @param basicAuth 
 * @param name Optional name for the webhook
 * @param eventName Optional webhook event name. Default is `EMAIL_RECEIVED` and is triggered when an email is received by the inbox associated with the webhook. Payload differ according to the webhook event name.
