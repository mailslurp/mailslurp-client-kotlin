/**
 * Conditions to apply to emails that you are waiting for
 * @param phoneNumberId ID of phone number to search within and apply conditions to. Essentially filtering the SMS found to give a count.
 * @param count Number of results that should match conditions. Either exactly or at least this amount based on the `countType`. If count condition is not met and the timeout has not been reached the `waitFor` method will retry the operation.
 * @param timeout Max time in milliseconds to retry the `waitFor` operation until conditions are met.
 * @param limit Limit results
 * @param delayTimeout Max time in milliseconds to wait between retries if a `timeout` is specified.
 * @param unreadOnly Apply conditions only to **unread** SMS. All SMS messages begin with `read=false`. An SMS is marked `read=true` when an `SMS` has been returned to the user at least once. For example you have called `getSms` or `waitForSms` etc., or you have viewed the SMS in the dashboard.
 * @param countType How result size should be compared with the expected size. Exactly or at-least matching result?
 * @param matches Conditions that should be matched for an SMS to qualify for results. Each condition will be applied in order to each SMS within a phone number to filter a result list of matching SMSs you are waiting for.
 * @param sortDirection Direction to sort matching SMSs by created time
 * @param since ISO Date Time earliest time of SMS to consider. Filter for matching SMSs that were received after this date
 * @param before ISO Date Time latest time of SMS to consider. Filter for matching SMSs that were received before this date
